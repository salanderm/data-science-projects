Welcome to my Data Science repository! This repository contains projects and implementations of various data science algorithms, including Linear Regression, K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These projects are built to demonstrate core machine learning concepts and techniques, using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

üìÅ Contents
Linear Regression
Predictive modeling for regression problems. Explore how to fit a line to data, evaluate performance using metrics like MSE and R¬≤, and interpret the coefficients.

K-Means Clustering
Unsupervised learning technique to cluster data into groups. Learn how to implement k-means, evaluate clusters with inertia, and visualize results.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Supervised classification algorithm. Use distance metrics to classify new data points based on the nearest neighbors.

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
A powerful supervised algorithm for classification. Learn about hyperplanes, kernel tricks, and parameter tuning for non-linear data.
